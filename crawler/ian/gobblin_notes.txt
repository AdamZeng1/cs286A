* to compile changes:
  - run "./gradlew build"
  - unpack gobblin-dist.tar.gz "tar -zxvf gobblin-dist.tar.gz"

* command to run gobblin from gobblin-dist/:
bin/gobblin-standalone.sh start --workdir ../test_workdir --conf ../test_config

* stdout goes into nohup.out

* need to import apache commons
  - in gobblin-example/build.gradle file, add a line to compile commons-io

* AvroDataWriterBuilder gets instantiated by gobblin-runtime/TaskContext.java:getDataWriterBuilder()

* In order to change the output from pure AVRO to the custom scheme defined by the repo group,
  - add a new case for "META_REPO" to the switch case for destination in gobblin-core/writer/AvroDataWriterBuilder.java
  - create a new DataWriter class (maybe just extend AvroHdfsDataWriter and override the write() method)
  - change line "this.writer.append(record)" to something that writes to this.stagingFile in the new format

* need to run "source run_gobblin_standalone.sh" so that the GOBBLIN_WORK_DIR and GOBBLIN_JOB_CONFIG_DIR
  environment variables become global. otherwise, when you try to run "stop", it won't be able to find
  the .gobblin-pid file
